# WPlLib Commands

In VSCode, you can use the keyboard command “Command+Shift+P”(macOS) or “Ctrl+Shift+P”(Windows) to access the command palette. Here are some important WPILib commands.



* **WPILib: Build Robot Code** - Builds open project using GradleRIO
* **WPILib: Create a new project** - Create a new robot project
* **WPILib: Cancel currently running tasks** - Cancel any tasks the WPILib extension is currently running
* **WPILib: Change Auto Save On Deploy Setting** - Change whether files are saved automatically when doing a Deploy. This defaults to Enabled.
* **WPILib: Change Auto Start RioLog on Deploy Setting** - Change whether RioLog starts automatically on deploy. This defaults to Enabled.
* **WPILib: Change Desktop Support Enabled Setting** - Change whether building robot code on Desktop is enabled. Enable this for test and simulation purposes. This defaults to Desktop Support off.
* **WPILib: Change Language Setting** - Change whether the currently open project is C++ or Java.
* **WPILib: Change Run Commands Except Deploy/Debug in Offline Mode Setting** - Change whether GradleRIO is running in Online Mode for commands other then deploy/debug (will attempt to automatically pull dependencies from online). Defaults to enabled (online mode).
* **WPILib: Change Run Deploy/Debug Command in Offline Mode Setting** - Change whether GradleRIO is running in Online Mode for deploy/debug (will attempt to automatically pull dependencies from online). Defaults to disabled (offline mode).
* **WPILib: Change Select Default Simulate Extension Setting** - Change whether simulation extensions are enabled by default (all simulation extensions defined in `build.gradle` will be enabled)
* **WPILib: Change Skip Tests On Deploy Setting** - Change whether to skip tests on deploy. Defaults to disabled (tests are run on deploy)
* **WPILib: Change Stop Simulation on Entry Setting** - Change whether to stop robot code on entry when running simulation. Defaults to disabled (don’t stop on entry).
* **WPILib: Change Use WinDbg Preview (From Store) as Windows Debugger Setting** - Change whether to use the VS Code debugger or WinDbg Preview (from Windows Store).
* **WPILib: Check for WPILib Updates** - Check for an update to the WPILib GradleRIO version for the project. This does not update the Visual Studio Code extension, tools, or offline dependencies. Users are strongly recommended to use the [offline wpilib installer](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html)
* **WPILib: Debug Robot Code** - Build and deploy robot code to roboRIO in debug mode and start debugging
* **WPILib: Deploy Robot Code** - Build and deploy robot code to roboRIO
* **WPILib: Hardware Sim Robot Code** - This builds the current robot code project on your PC and starts it running in simulation using hardware attached to the comupter rather then pure software simulation. Requires vendor support.
* **WPILib: Import a WPILib 2020/2021/2022 Gradle Project** - Open a wizard to help you create a new project from a existing VS Code Gradle project from 2020-2022. Further documentation is at [importing gradle project](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vscode-overview/importing-gradle-project.html)
* **WPILib: Install tools from GradleRIO** - Install the WPILib Java tools (e.g. SmartDashboard, Shuffleboard, etc.). Note that this is done by default by the offline installer

* **WPILib: Open API Documentation** - Opens either the WPILib Javadocs or C++ Doxygen documentation
* **WPILib: Open Project Information** - Opens a widget with project information (Project version, extension version, etc.)
* **WPILib: Open WPILib Command Palette** - This command is used to open a WPILib Command Palette (equivalent of hitting `Ctrl+Shift+P` and typing `WPILib`)
* **WPILib: Open WPILib Help** - This opens a simple page which links to the WPILib documentation (this site)
* **WPILib: Reset Ask for WPILib Updates Flag**- This will clear the flag on the current project, allowing you to re-prompt to update a project to the latest WPILib version if you previously chose to not update.
* **WPILib: Run a command in Gradle** - This lets you run an arbitrary command in the GradleRIO command environment
* **WPILib: Set Team Number** - Used to modify the team number associated with a project. This is only needed if you need to change the team number from the one initially specified when creating the project.
* **WPILib: Set VS Code Java Home to FRC Home** - Set the VS Code Java Home variable to point to the Java Home discovered by the FRC extension. This is needed if not using the offline installer to make sure the intellisense settings are in sync with the WPILib build settings.
* **WPILib: Show Log Folder** - Shows the folder where the WPILib extension stores internal logs. This may be useful when debugging/reporting an extension issue to the WPILib developers
* **WPILib: Simulate Robot Code** - This builds the current robot code project on your PC and starts it running in simulation. This requires Desktop Support to be set to Enabled.
* **WPILib: Start RioLog** - This starts the RioLog display used to view console output from a robot program
* **WPILib: Start Tool** - This allows you to launch WPILib tools (e.g. SmartDashboard, Shuffleboard, etc.) from inside VS Code
* **WPILib: Test Robot Code** - This builds the current robot code project and runs any created tests. This requires Desktop Support to be set to Enabled.


# Base Class

To start a project using one of the WPILib robot program templates, users must first choose a base class for their robot. Users subclass these base classes to create their primary `Robot` class, which controls the main flow of the robot program. 

The recommended base class is _TimedRobot._

_ The <code>TimedRobot</code> class is the base class recommended for most users. It provides control of the robot program through a collection of <code>init()</code>, <code>periodic()</code>, and <code>exit()</code> methods, which are called by WPILib during specific robot states (e.g. autonomous or teleoperated). During these calls, your code typically polls each input device and acts according to the data it receives. For instance, you would typically determine the position of the joystick and state of the joystick buttons on each call and act accordingly. The <code>TimedRobot</code> class also provides an example of retrieving autonomous routines through SendableChooser</em>


```
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.TimedRobot;

/**
 * The VM is configured to automatically run this class, and to call the functions corresponding to
 * each mode, as described in the TimedRobot documentation. If you change the name of this class or
 * the package after creating this project, you must also update the build.gradle file in the
 * project.
 */
public class Robot extends TimedRobot {

    /**
     * This function is run when the robot is first started up and should be used for any
     * initialization code.
     */
    @Override
    public void robotInit() {}

    @Override
    public void robotPeriodic() {}

    @Override
    public void autonomousInit() {}

    @Override
    public void autonomousPeriodic() {}

    @Override
    public void teleopInit() {}

    @Override
    public void teleopPeriodic() {}

    @Override
    public void disabledInit() {}

    @Override
    public void disabledPeriodic() {}

    @Override
    public void testInit() {}

    @Override
    public void testPeriodic() {}

    @Override
    public void simulationInit() {}

    @Override
    public void simulationPeriodic() {}
}
```


Periodic methods are called every 20 ms by default. This can be changed by calling the superclass constructor with the new desired update rate.


```
public Robot() {
  super(0.03); // Periodic methods will now be called every 30 ms.
}
```



# Creating New WPlLib Project



1. Go to VSCode and open command palette using “Command+Shift+P” or “Ctrl+Shift+P”
2. Search and select “Create a new project”

![alt_text](images/image7.png "image_tooltip")

3. You will see a “New Project Creator Window”
    1. **Project Type**: The kind of project we wish to create. This can be an example project, or one of the project templates provided by WPILib. Templates exist for each of the robot base classes. Additionally, a template exists for [Command-based](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/what-is-command-based.html#what-is-command-based-programming) projects, which are built on the TimedRobot base class but include a number of additional features - this type of robot program is highly recommended for new teams.
    2. **Language**: Language (C++ or Java) used for project
    3. **Base Folder**: Specifies the type of template that will be used.
    4. **Project Location**: Folder in which the robot project will be located.
    5. **Project Name**: The name of the robot project. Also specifies the name that the project folder will be given if the Create New Folder box is checked.
    6. **Create a New Folder**: If this is checked, a new folder will be created to hold the project within the previously-specified folder. If it is not checked, the project will be located directly in the previously-specified folder. An error will be thrown if the folder is not empty and this is not checked.
    7. **Team Number**: The team number for the project, which will be used for package names within the project and to locate the robot when deploying code.
    8. **Enable Desktop Support**: Enables unit test and simulation. While WPILib supports this, third party software libraries may not. If libraries do not support desktop, then your code may not compile or may crash. It should be left unchecked unless unit testing or simulation is needed and all libraries support it.
4. Click on “Yes (New Window)”

# Installing 3rd Party Libraries

What are vendor dependencies?

Vendor Dependencies are a way for vendors, ex) REV, to add their software library to robots.This library can control motor controllers and other devices. Vendor dependencies are installed on a per-project basis. A [JSON](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/frc-glossary.html#term-JSON) file describing the vendor library is installed on your system to `~/wpilib/YYYY/vendordeps` (where YYYY is the year and ~ is `C:\Users\Public` on Windows).

Installation



1. Open command palette and type WPlLib, or click on the WPILib Icon on top right
2. Type “Manage Vendor Libraries”, and select it
3. Select desired libraries to add and hit OK


# Building and Deploying Code

Robot projects must be compiled (“built”) and deployed in order to run on the roboRIO. Since the code is not compiled natively on the robot controller, this is known as “cross-compilation.”

To build and deploy a robot project, do one of:



1. Open the Command Palette and enter/select “Build Robot Code”
2. Open the shortcut menu indicated by the ellipses in the top right corner of the VS Code window and select “Build Robot Code”
3. Right-click on the build.gradle file in the project hierarchy and select “Build Robot Code”

If successful, we will see a “Build Successful” message (1) and the RioLog will open with the console output from the robot program as it runs (2).


# Console Output

The two ways of looking at console output are are through the Console Viewer in the FRC Driver Station and the Rioplug plugin in VSCode


## Console Viewer



<p id="gdcalert9" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image9.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert10">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image9.png "image_tooltip")


To open Console Viewer, first open the FRC® Driver Station. Then, click on the gear at the top of the message viewer window (1) and select “View Console”.

![alt_text](images/image10.png "image_tooltip")



## Rioplug Plugin

“Ctrl+Shift+P” and type _WPILib: Start Riolog_



<p id="gdcalert11" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image11.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert12">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image11.png "image_tooltip")




* **Pause/Resume Display** - This will pause/resume the display. 
* **Discard/Accept Incoming** - This will toggle whether to accept new packets. When packets are being discarded the display will be paused and all packets received will be discarded. Clicking the button again will resume receiving packets.
* **Clear** - This will clear the current contents of the display.
* **Don’t Show/Show Prints** - This shows or hides messages categorized as print statements
* **Switch to Viewer** - This switches to viewer for saved log files
* **Don’t Show/Show Warnings** - This shows or hides messages categorized as warnings
* **Disconnect/Reconnect** - This disconnects or reconnects to the console stream
* **Show/Don’t Show Timestamps** - Shows or hides timestamps on messages in the window
* **Save Log** - Copies the log contents into a file you can save and view or open later with the RioLog viewer (see Switch to Viewer above)
* **Set Team Number** - Sets the team number of the roboRIO to connect to the console stream on, set automatically if RioLog is launched by the deploy process


# Debugging

Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `WPILib` or click on the **WPILib Menu Item** to open the Command palette with WPILib pre-populated. Type Debug and select the Debug Robot Code menu item to start debugging. The code will download to the roboRIO and begin debugging.


# ShuffleBoard

ShuffleBoard is a dashboard for FRC C++ and Java programs.



<p id="gdcalert12" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image12.png).

![alt_text](images/image12.png "image_tooltip")




1. **Sources area**: Here are data sources from which you can choose values from NetworkTables, a publish-subscribe messaging system to communicate data between programs, or other sources to display by dragging a value into one of the tabs
2. **Tab panes**: This is where your data is displayed from the robot or other sources. In this example it is Test-mode subsystems that are shown here in the LiveWindow tab. This area can show any number of tabbed windows, and each window has its own set of properties like grid size and auto-populate.
3. **Record/playback controls**: set of media-like controls where you can playback the current session to see historical data


## Start Shuffleboard



<p id="gdcalert13" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image13.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert14">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image13.png "image_tooltip")


2 Best Ways to start ShuffleBoard:



1. You can automatically start it when the Driver Station starts by setting the “Dashboard Type” to Shuffleboard in the settings tab
2. You can start from with Visual Studio Code by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P and type “WPILib” or click the WPILib logo in the top right to launch the WPILib Command Palette. Select Start Tool, then select Shuffleboard.


## Get Robot Data on Dashboard

Ex) See a field displayed with the label “Joystick X value” and a value of the X value of the joystick. Each time this line of code is executed, a new joystick value will be sent to Shuffleboard


```
SmartDashboard.putNumber("Joystick X value", joystick1.getX());
```


Often debugging or monitoring the status of a robot involves writing a number of values to the console and watching them stream by. With Shuffleboard you can put values to a GUI that is automatically constructed based on your program. As values are updated, the corresponding GUI element changes value - there is no need to try to catch numbers streaming by on the screen.


```
protected void execute() {
    SmartDashboard.putBoolean("Bridge Limit", bridgeTipper.atBridge());
    SmartDashboard.putNumber("Bridge Angle", bridgeTipper.getPosition());
    SmartDashboard.putNumber("Swerve Angle", drivetrain.getSwerveAngle());
    SmartDashboard.putNumber("Left Drive Encoder", drivetrain.getLeftEncoder());
    SmartDashboard.putNumber("Right Drive Encoder", drivetrain.getRightEncoder());
    SmartDashboard.putNumber("Turret Pot", turret.getCurrentAngle());
    SmartDashboard.putNumber("Turret Pot Voltage", turret.getAverageVoltage());
    SmartDashboard.putNumber("RPM", shooter.getRPM());
}
```

![alt_text](images/image14.png "image_tooltip")




* Numeric types such as char, int, long, float or double call SmartDashboard.putNumber(“dashboard-name”, value).
* String types call SmartDashboard.putString(“dashboard-name”, value)

Creating and Using Tabs

Creating


```
ShuffleboardTab tab = Shuffleboard.getTab("Tab Title");
```


Opening


```
Shuffleboard.selectTab("Tab Title");
```


Cons



* Not saved in the Shuffleboard save file
* No support for autopopulation
* Users are expected to specify the tab contents in their robot program
* Have a special color to differentiate from normal tabs


## Sending Data to Tabs


```
Shuffleboard.getTab("Numbers").add("Pi", 3.14);
```


Updating


```
class VisionCalculator {
   private ShuffleboardTab tab = Shuffleboard.getTab("Vision");
   private NetworkTableEntry distanceEntry =
       tab.add("Distance to target", 0)
          .getEntry();

   public void calculate() {
     double distance = ...;
     distanceEntry.setDouble(distance);
   }
 }
Call getEntry() after defining the value, then update it when needed or in a periodic function


Retrieving Data
class DriveBase extends Subsystem {
   private ShuffleboardTab tab = Shuffleboard.getTab("Drive");
   private NetworkTableEntry maxSpeed =
       tab.add("Max Speed", 1)
          .getEntry();

   private DifferentialDrive robotDrive = ...;

   public void drive(double left, double right) {
     // Retrieve the maximum speed from the dashboard
     double max = maxSpeed.getDouble(1.0);
     robotDrive.tankDrive(left * max, right * max);
   }
}
.getDouble() gets the value at the Max Speed widget.

```



## Specify Widget Properties


```
Shuffleboard.getTab("Drive")
    .add("Max Speed", 1)
    .withWidget(BuiltInWidgets.kNumberSlider)
    .withProperties(Map.of("min", 0, "max", 1)) // specify widget properties here
    .getEntry();
```


Using .withProperties(), we can specify the specifics of the widget. In this case, it is a slider. The default slider is -1 to 1, which may cause problems, so we can change it to 0 to 1.


# Telemetry


## What is Telemetry? 

Telemetry is the process of collecting, transmitting, and analyzing data from remote or inaccessible sources. Recording and viewing telemetry data is a crucial part of the engineering process - accurate telemetry data helps you tune your robot to perform optimally, and is indispensable for debugging your robot when it fails to perform as expected.

Advantages over dashboards:



1. Recording data on the robot means more data can be collected because of the lessened presence of bandwidth limitations
2. All the recorded data can be very accurately timestamped
3. WPILib has integrated support for on-robot recording of telemetry data via the DataLogManager and DataLog classes and provides a tool for downloading data log files and converting them to CSV.


## Sendables

The _Sendable_ interface is able to register value listeners that automatically send data to the dashboard - and, in some cases, receive values back. Many WPILib classes (such as [Commands](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/dashboards/shuffleboard/advanced-usage/shuffleboard-commands-subsystems.html#commands-and-subsystems)) already implement Sendable, and so can be sent to the dashboard without any user modification. The Sendable interface contains only one method: initSendable. Implementing classes override this method to perform the binding of in-code data values to structured [JSON](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/frc-glossary.html#term-JSON) data, which is then automatically sent to the robot dashboard via NetworkTables. 

To send a Sendable object to your dashboard: use _putData_ method:


```
SmartDashboard.putData("Arm PID", armPIDController);
```



## Data Logs

By default, no data is recorded on the robot. The _DataLogManager_ class provides a convenient wrapper around the lower-level _DataLog_ class for on-robot recording of telemetry data into data logs.

Data Logs are similar to Network Tables, but their data types cannot be changed once created, they are unidirectional(_DataLog_ can only write, _DataLogReader_ can only read), and a series of timestamped records.

It provides automatic data log file management.  It automatically cleans up old files when disk space is low and renames the file based either on current date/time or competition match number. The data file will be saved to a USB flash drive if one is attached, or to /home/lvuser otherwise.

Log files are initially named _FRC_TBD_{random}.wpilog_ until the DS connects. After the DS(Driver Station) connects, the log file is renamed to _FRC_yyyyMMdd_HHmmss.wpilog_ (where the date/time is UTC). If the FMS is connected and provides a match number, the log file is renamed to _FRC_yyyyMMdd_HHmmss_{event}_{match}.wpilog_.

On startup, all existing log files where a DS has not been connected will be deleted. If there is less than 50 MB of free space on the target storage, FRC_ log files are deleted (oldest to newest) until there is 50 MB free OR there are 10 files remaining.

Will record all Network Table changes to datalog:


```
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.DataLogManager;

// Starts recording to data log
DataLogManager.start();
```


DataLogManager provides a convenience function (DataLogManager.log()) for logging of text messages to the messages entry in the data log. The message is also printed to standard output, so this can be a replacement for System.out.println().

DataLogManager also records the current roboRIO system time (in UTC) to the data log every ~5 seconds to the systemTime entry in the data log. This can be used to (roughly) synchronize the data log with other records such as DS logs or match video.

Logging Joystick Data

By default, joystick data isn’t logged. The code below logs iit:


```
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.DataLogManager;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.DriverStation;

// Starts recording to data log
DataLogManager.start();

// Record both DS control and joystick data
DriverStation.startDataLog(DataLogManager.getLog());

// (alternatively) Record only DS control data
DriverStation.startDataLog(DataLogManager.getLog(), false);
```


Custom Data Logging


```
import edu.wpi.first.util.datalog.BooleanLogEntry;
import edu.wpi.first.util.datalog.DataLog;
import edu.wpi.first.util.datalog.DoubleLogEntry;
import edu.wpi.first.util.datalog.StringLogEntry;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.DataLogManager;

BooleanLogEntry myBooleanLog;
DoubleLogEntry myDoubleLog;
StringLogEntry myStringLog;

public void robotInit() {
  // Starts recording to data log
  DataLogManager.start();

  // Set up custom log entries
  DataLog log = DataLogManager.getLog();
  myBooleanLog = new BooleanLogEntry(log, "/my/boolean");
  myDoubleLog = new DoubleLogEntry(log, "/my/double");
  myStringLog = new StringLogEntry(log, "/my/string");
}

public void teleopPeriodic() {
  if (...) {
    // Only log when necessary
    myBooleanLog.append(true);
    myDoubleLog.append(3.5);
    myStringLog.append("wow!");
  }
}
```


Download Datalogs 

For when the data logs are not stored on USB drive and on roboRIO integrated flash memory.

To facilitate this, the DataLogTool desktop application integrates a SFTP client for downloading data log files from a network device (e.g. roboRIO or coprocessor) to the local computer.

This process consists of four steps:



1. Connect to roboRIO or coprocessor
2. Navigate to remote directory and select what files to download
3. Select download folder
4. Download files and optionally delete remote files after downloading

# Hardware APIs


## Motors

Motor Controllers are responsible for making your motors and therefore your robot move. These are the legal controllers as of 2023.

* Victor SPX Motor Controller (P/N: 217-9191, 17-868388, am-3748)

Motor controllers are either CAN or PWM. A CAN controller can send more detailed status information back to the roboRIO, while a PWM controller can only be set to a single value. PWM and CAN controllers can be controlled using the same methods. All approved motor controllers have WPI classes provided for them.


```
Spark spark = new Spark(0); // 0 is the RIO PWM port this is connected to
spark.set(-0.75); // the % output of the motor, between -1 and 1
VictorSP victor = new VictorSP(0); // 0 is the RIO PWM port this is connected to
victor.set(0.6); // the % output of the motor, between -1 and 1
```



## Pulse Width Modification(PWM)

PWM can refer to both the input signal and method the controller uses to control motor speed. To do so, the controller must vary the perceived input voltage of the motor. The controller switches the full input voltage on and off very quickly. 

Controllers signaling for input involves signals with a period of either 5ms or 10ms and a midpoint pulse width of 1.5ms. 

Raw and Scaled Values

In general, all of the motor controller classes in WPILib take a scaled -1.0 to 1.0 value as the output to an actuator. The PWM module in the FPGA on the roboRIO is capable of generating PWM signals with periods of 5, 10, or 20ms and can vary the pulse width in 2000 steps of ~.001ms each around the midpoint (1000 steps in each direction around the midpoint). The raw values sent to this module are in this 0-2000 range with 0 being a special case which holds the signal low (disabled). The class for each motor controller contains information about what the typical bound values (min, max and each side of the deadband) are as well as the typical midpoint. WPILib can then use these values to map the scaled value into the proper range for the motor controller. This allows for the code to switch seamlessly between different types of controllers and abstracts out the details of the specific signaling.

Motor Calibration

The values WPILib uses for scaling are approximate based on measurement of a number of samples of each controller type. Due to a variety of factors, the timing of an individual motor controller may vary slightly. In order to definitively eliminate “humming” (midpoint signal interpreted as slight movement in one direction) and drive the controller all the way to each extreme, calibrating the controllers is still recommended. In general, the calibration procedure for each controller involves putting the controller into calibration mode then driving the input signal to each extreme, then back to the midpoint.


## Motor Controls

Inversions

The right side of drivetrains are not inverted by default. The code below does so for a PWMSparkMax controller:


```
PWMSparkMax m_motorRight = new PWMSparkMax(0);
@Override
public void robotInit() {
   m_motorRight.setInverted(true);
}
```


Squaring Inputs

When driving robots, it is often desirable to manipulate the joystick inputs such that the robot has finer control at low speeds while still using the full output range. One way to accomplish this is by squaring the joystick input, then reapplying the sign. By default the Differential Drive class will square the inputs. If this is not desired (e.g. if passing values in from a PIDController), use one of the drive methods with the squaredInputs parameter and set it to false.

Input Deadbands

By default, the Differential Drive class applies an input deadband of 0.02. This means that input values with a magnitude below 0.02 (after any squaring as described above) will be set to 0. In most cases these small inputs result from imperfect joystick centering and are not sufficient to cause drivetrain movement, the deadband helps reduce unnecessary motor heating that may result from applying these small values to the drivetrain. To change the deadband, use the setDeadband() method.

Maximum Output

Sometimes drivers feel that their drivetrain is driving too fast and want to limit the output. This can be accomplished with the setMaxOutput() method. This maximum output is multiplied by the result of the previous drive functions like deadband and squared inputs.

Motor Safety

These mechanisms are used as “watchdogs”, to disable mechanisms that may potentially be harmful to themselves, the robot, people, or surroundings. Examples of mechanisms that should be Motor Safety Enabled are drive trains and arms. By default Differential Drive and Mecanum Drive objects have it enabled. 

The Motor Safety feature operates by maintaining a timer that tracks how long it has been since the feed() method has been called for that actuator. Code in the Driver Station class initiates a comparison of these timers to the timeout values for any actuator with safety enabled every 5 received packets (100ms nominal). The set() methods of each motor controller class and the set() and setAngle() methods of the servo class call feed() to indicate that the output of the actuator has been updated.


```
exampleJaguar.setSafetyEnabled(true);
exampleJaguar.setSafetyEnabled(false);
exampleJaguar.setExpiration(.1);
exampleJaguar.feed()
```


Axis Conventions

Drive classes use NWU(North-West-Up). The positive X axis points ahead, the positive Y axis points left, and the positive Z axis points up.

Joysticks use NEU(North-East-Down). The positive X axis points ahead, the positive Y axis points right, and the positive Z axis points down.

Using Differential Drive

Method provided for control of “skid-steer” and “west coast” drivetrains, such as the kit of parts from registration. Initializing a Differential Drive: 


```
public class Robot {
    Spark m_left = new Spark(1);
    Spark m_right = new Spark(2);
    DifferentialDrive m_drive = new DifferentialDrive(m_left, m_right);

    public void robotInit() {
        m_left.setInverted(true); // if you want to invert motor outputs, you must do so here
    }
```


Multi-Motor Differential Drive with Motor Controller Groups

In order to use multiple motors, each side has to be collected in a single _MotorController_, using the _MotorControllerGroup_ class. To use even more motors, create more controller instances and pass to MotorControllerGroup constructor. 4 motor, 2 per side drivetrain: 


```
public class Robot {
    Spark m_frontLeft = new Spark(1);
    Spark m_rearLeft = new Spark(2);
    MotorControllerGroup m_left = new MotorControllerGroup(m_frontLeft, m_rearLeft);

    Spark m_frontRight = new Spark(3);
    Spark m_rearRight = new Spark(4);
    MotorControllerGroup m_right = new MotorControllerGroup(m_frontRight, m_rearRight);
    DifferentialDrive m_drive = new DifferentialDrive(m_left, m_right);

    public void robotInit() {
        m_left.setInverted(true); // if you want to invert the entire side you can do so here
    }
```


Drive Modes

The three default modes



* Tank Drive, which controls the left and right side independently
* Arcade Drive, which controls a forward and turn speed
* Curvature Drive, a subset of Arcade Drive, which makes your robot handle like a car with constant-curvature turns.


```
public void teleopPeriodic() {
    // Tank drive with a given left and right rates
    myDrive.tankDrive(-leftStick.getY(), -rightStick.getY());

    // Arcade drive with a given forward and turn rate
    myDrive.arcadeDrive(-driveStick.getY(), -driveStick.getX());

    // Curvature drive with a given forward and turn rate, as well as a button for turning in-place.
    myDrive.curvatureDrive(-driveStick.getY(), -driveStick.getX(), driveStick.getButton(1));
}
```

## Joysticks

A joystick can be used with the Driver Station program to control the robot. Almost any “controller” that can be recognized by Windows can be used as a joystick. Each axis of the controller ranges from -1 to 1. 

_Joystick_ class


```
Joystick exampleJoystick = new Joystick(0); // 0 is the USB Port to be used as indicated on the Driver Station
```




<p id="gdcalert23" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image23.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert24">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image23.png "image_tooltip")


The `Joystick` class is designed to make using a flight joystick to operate the robot significantly easier. Depending on the flight joystick, the user may need to set the specific X, Y, Z, and Throttle channels that your flight joystick uses. This class offers special methods for accessing the angle and magnitude of the flight joystick.

_XboxController_ Class


```
XboxController exampleXbox = new XboxController(0); // 0 is the USB Port to be used as indicated on the Driver Station
```




<p id="gdcalert24" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image24.png).

![alt_text](images/image24.png "image_tooltip")


The `XboxController` class provides named methods (e.g. `getXButton`, `getXButtonPressed`, `getXButtonReleased`) for each of the buttons, and the indices can be accessed with `XboxController.Button.kX.value`. The rumble feature of the controller can be controlled by using `XboxController.setRumble(GenericHID.RumbleType.kRightRumble, value)`. Many users do a split stick arcade drive that uses the left stick for just forwards / backwards and the right stick for left / right turning.

_PS4Controller_ Class


```
PS4Controller examplePS4 = new PS4Controller(0); // 0 is the USB Port to be used as indicated on the Driver Station
```




<p id="gdcalert25" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image25.png).

![alt_text](images/image25.png "image_tooltip")


The `PS4Controller` class provides named methods (e.g. `getSquareButton`, `getSquareButtonPressed`, `getSquareButtonReleased`) for each of the buttons, and the indices can be accessed with `PS4Controller.Button.kSquare.value`. The rumble feature of the controller can be controlled by using `PS4Controller.setRumble(GenericHID.RumbleType.kRightRumble, value)`.

Button Usage


```
if (joystick.getRawButtonPressed(0)) {
   turnIntakeOn(); // When pressed the intake turns on
}
if (joystick.getRawButtonReleased(0)) {
   turnIntakeOff(); // When released the intake turns off
}

OR

if (joystick.getRawButton(0)) {
   turnIntakeOn();
} else {
   turnIntakeOff();
}
```


Toggle Button


```
boolean toggle = false;

if (joystick.getRawButtonPressed(0)) {
   if (toggle) {
      // Current state is true so turn off
      retractIntake();
      toggle = false;
   } else {
      // Current state is false so turn on
      deployIntake();
      toggle = true;
   }
}
```



## Robot Preferences


```
 public static final String kArmPositionKey = "ArmPosition";
 public static final String kArmPKey = "ArmP";

 // The P gain for the PID controller that drives this arm.
 public static final double kDefaultArmKp = 50.0;
 public static final double kDefaultArmSetpointDegrees = 75.0;

 // The P gain for the PID controller that drives this arm.
 private double m_armKp = Constants.kDefaultArmKp;
 private double m_armSetpointDegrees = Constants.kDefaultArmSetpointDegrees;
  /** Subsystem constructor. */
 public Arm() {
    // Set the Arm position setpoint and P constant to Preferences if the keys don't already exist
   Preferences.initDouble(Constants.kArmPositionKey, m_armSetpointDegrees);
   Preferences.initDouble(Constants.kArmPKey, m_armKp);
}
```
